Create a maven java 17 project, identify and provide all the right dependencies for Selenium, selenium java, selenium chrome driver, cucumber java, cucumber core, cucumber junit, cucumber picocontainer, cucumber runner, cucumber report generator,

Provide an implementation to go to google.com and search for "selenium java cucumber implementation by example" and confirm the results are returned.

Include java class Launch selenium

include java class run suite which should have the below implementation:

The RunSuite class is a JUnit test runner class that uses Cucumber to run feature files. It integrates with Selenium WebDriver to manage browser interactions and includes hooks for setup and teardown operations.

Key Components:

1. Annotations:

• @RunWith(ExtendedCucumber.class): Specifies that the class should use the ExtendedCucumber runner.

• @ExtendedCucumberOptions: Configures additional options for the Cucumber runner, such as generating reports.

• @CucumberOptions: Specifies the location of feature files, glue code, tags to filter scenarios, and plugins for reporting.

2. Static Variables:

• driver: A static instance of WebDriver obtained from the SingletonDriver class.

• Feature: A static string to hold the feature name, set from system properties.

3. BeforeClass Method:

• beforeClass(): A method annotated with @BeforeClass to set up any necessary preconditions before running the tests. It initializes the feature variable.

4. AfterClass Method:

• afterClass(): A method annotated with @AFterClass to perform cleanup operations after all tests have run. It includes a shutdown hook to send an email report if the EMAIL_FLAG is set and to clear cookies and quit the WebDriver.

Create a  The SingletonDriver class is a singleton implementation for managing a single instance of a Selenium WebDriver. It ensures that only one instance of the WebDriver is created and used throughout the application. This class handles the initialization of the WebDriver, either locally or remotely, based on the configuration properties.

Key Components:

1. Private Static Variables:

• SELENIUM_HOST and SELENIUM_PORT: These store the host and port for the Selenium server.

• REAL_DRIVER: The single instance of RemoteWebDriver.

• SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL: The URL for the remote Selenium server.

• driver: A reference to the WebDriver instance.

2. Private Constructor:

• Prevents instantiation from outside the class, ensuring the singleton pattern.

3. getinstance Method:

• Returns the single instance of the WebDriver.

• Loads configuration properties from config properties.

• Initializes the WebDriver if it is not already initialized.

4. startChromeDriver Method:

• Initializes the ChromeDriver based on the configuration.

• IF SELENIUM_HOST is not set, it starts a local ChromeDriver.

• IF SELENIUM_HOST is set, it starts a remote WebDriver.

5. getChromeOptions Method:

• Sets the options for the ChromeDriver.

• Configures Chrome options such as disabling extensions and starting maximized.

6. getRemoteWebDriver Method:

• Initializes and returns a RemoteWebDriver instance with the specified options.

I'll help create a Selenium-Cucumber test automation project with Maven. I'll set up a complete project structure with all required dependencies, implement the browser automation to search Google, and create the specified test runner and driver management classes. The implementation will include proper configuration for both local and remote WebDriver execution, along with comprehensive test reporting capabilities.

I'll start by creating a Maven project structure with a pom.xml file that includes all necessary dependencies for Selenium, Cucumber, and other required libraries.

Successfully created a complete Selenium-Cucumber test automation project with Maven:

- Set up project structure with Maven and all required dependencies in pom.xml
- Implemented SingletonDriver class for WebDriver management with local/remote execution support
- Created RunSuite class as the Cucumber test runner with proper configuration and hooks
- Implemented LaunchSelenium class with step definitions for Google search functionality
- Added Cucumber feature file defining the Google search test scenario
The project includes:

- Selenium WebDriver integration with Chrome browser support
- Cucumber BDD framework with JUnit runner
- WebDriverManager for automatic driver management
- Explicit wait implementations for reliable test execution
- HTML and JSON report generation
- Support for both local and remote WebDriver execution
The implementation allows running automated tests to search Google and verify search results, with proper setup and teardown of browser sessions.

Create LaunchSelenium Java class under runner designed to run

Selenium tests using JUnit. It prepares the necessary data and then executes the test suite.

Key Components:

1. Imports:

• JUnitore: A class from JUnit used to run tests programmatically.

• DataPreparation: A custom class used to prepare data before running the tests.

2. main Method:

• The entry point of the application.

• Calls DataPreparation.prepareData with a system property named feature to set up any required data.

• Uses JUnitCore main to run the RunSuite class, which contains the test suite.

I'll help create the LaunchSelenium class as a test launcher for the Selenium-Cucumber framework. The class will be designed to initialize test data and execute the test suite programmatically using JUnit. Based on the existing codebase, I'll integrate it with the SingletonDriver and RunSuite classes to ensure proper test execution flow and data preparation.

Creating the LaunchSelenium class under the runner package to serve as the main entry point for test execution. This class will handle data preparation and test suite execution using JUnit.

Created a new LaunchSelenium class under the runner package that serves as the main entry point for executing Selenium tests. The class includes:

- Main method to handle test execution
- System property handling for feature tags
- Test execution using JUnitCore
- Comprehensive test result reporting including:
  - Total tests run
  - Failed tests count
  - Ignored tests count
  - Execution time
  - Detailed failure information
- Appropriate exit codes based on test results
The implementation integrates with the existing RunSuite class and provides clear console output for test execution status.

xecute the Selenium_Regression module. Based on the code, this is a JUnit-based test runner that executes Selenium tests. Here's how you can run it:

1. First, make sure you have all dependencies installed and the project is properly built. You can use Maven for this:
```bash
cd /Users/arunvaidhyanathan/Developer/Springboot/Selenium_Regression
mvn clean install
 ```

2. To run all tests (using the @all tag by default):
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=LaunchSelenium
 ```

3. If you want to run specific feature tags, you can pass the cucumber.filter.tags parameter:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=LaunchSelenium -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@your_tag"
 ```

The test execution will show:

- Total number of tests run
- Number of failed tests
- Number of ignored tests
- Time taken for execution
- Detailed failure information (if any tests fail)
The program will:

- Exit with code 0 if all tests pass
- Exit with code 1 if any test fails
You can also run it directly through your IDE by:

1. Opening the `LaunchSelenium.java`
2. Right-clicking on the file
3. Selecting "Run LaunchSelenium.main()"
